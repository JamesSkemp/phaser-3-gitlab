# Starter Project for Phaser 3  with GitLab Pages Support

The following is a fast starter project to get started with a new game in Phaser 3, running on GitLab Pages.

This project is based upon https://github.com/JamesSkemp/phaser-3-vsc-typescript-nodejs

## Get Started

1. Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed.
2. From a command line, run `npm install` in the root directory (same place this README.md file is).
3. Next run `npm run start:dev` to start an automatically updating instance.
4. Use the editor of your choice ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a great choice) to start writing your game.
5. Run `npm run build` to populate the **public** directory with the final site contents.
6. Copy the contents of **public** to the site of your choice, or if published on GitLab, the site should automatically generate.

## Upgrading Phaser
To upgrade Phaser 3 run `npm upgrade --save phaser`.
